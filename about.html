            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
            discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around

            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you

            Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more
            about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
            monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
