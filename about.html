            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
            discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around
            us.

            Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
            experiment with our team of experts.

            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
            can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
            Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more
            about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.
