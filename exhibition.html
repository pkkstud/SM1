                    <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live
                        through exhibits. This
                        is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore.
                        Many
                        of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to
                        life
                        (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

                        Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The SkyAbove Us’, explores the
                        night
                        sky
                        and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
                        constellations
                        and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to
                        travel by.

                        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved,
                        thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
                        history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
                        penicillin and the first heart transplant.

                        Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
                        animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                        As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it
                        becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for
                        the whole planet.

                        contribute to a brighter future.
