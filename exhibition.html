                    <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live
                        through exhibits. This
                        is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore.
                        Many
                        of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to
                        life
                        (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

                        Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The SkyAbove Us’, explores the
                        night
                        sky
                        and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
                        constellations
                        and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to
                        travel by.

                        For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where
                        do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have
                        had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

                        here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

                        In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global
                        warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
                        contribute to a brighter future.

                        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved,
                        thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
                        history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
                        penicillin and the first heart transplant.
